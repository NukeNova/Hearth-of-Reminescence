# Hearth-of-Reminescence


Personal little project on making a broad linux cheat sheet


### **Beginning**



### [tlp](https://linrunner.de/tlp/)
For controlling cpu properties
tlp is configured in its ``/etc/tlp.conf`` directory and is started via

` # Systemctl start tlp.service `


### [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/index.html)
for java

Packaged in almost every distro's repository

run `$ java -jar` to execute java executables




### [Sha256sum](https://man.archlinux.org/man/sha256sum.1.en)

run `$ sha256sum -c 'hashsum.txt' 'funky.iso`

For checking sha256sums

if hashum file has multiple hashies add ` --ignore-missing`
